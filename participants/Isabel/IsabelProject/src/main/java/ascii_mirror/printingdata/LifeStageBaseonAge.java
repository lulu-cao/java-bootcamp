//Your task is to write a complete Java program that takes in a single line with an integer between 0-100 (inclusive) as input. This integer represents a person's age. The program should then print a message that tells the person which life stage they are in based on the following conditions:
//If the person's age is less than 12 (inclusive), print 'Child'.
//If the age is between 13 and 17 (both inclusive), print 'Teenager'.
//If the age is between 18 and 59 (both inclusive), print 'Adult'.
//Lastly, if the person's age is 60 (inclusive) or above, print 'Senior Citizen'.
    //Contrains:
    //inputs 12, output: Child
    //inputs 13, output: Teenager
